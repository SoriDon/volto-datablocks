# Data-connected Volto components 

This addon has various blocks and utilities to provide "data-connected" components in Volto websites.

### What is a "data-connected component?"

A data-connected component, as we use the term here, is a component that displays information coming from outside sources. For example, a chart would get its data from an uploaded CSV file, or a block can display values that come from a REST api server (discodata.eea.europa.eu), there's even a prototype "data-connected entity" for the draftjs richtext editor.
